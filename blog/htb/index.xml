      <description>&lt;p&gt;Union is a box that is heavily focused on, you guessed in, UNION-based SQL injection. This box was a little difficult to find the initial injection because you almost have to know a valid player&amp;rsquo;s name, or guess that the table is named &amp;ldquo;players&amp;rdquo;. Without those, you would get the same result each time essentially masking the SQL injection. Additionally, SQLMap is blocked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As always, starting off with our nmap scans, we do a quick and comprehensive scan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>HTB Forest Write-up</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Forest machine is a unique box due to it being entirely Active Directory. I agree with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9FcE_FMZio&#34;&gt;IppSec&lt;/a&gt; that this box should probably be rated medium rather than easy. However, I think this is a great box to practice your Active Directory enumeration skills and really dig into using BloodHound to find specific attack paths. There is a funky aspect of this box in which a script is being run to reset your user&amp;rsquo;s privileges, and this causes some weird problems you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
